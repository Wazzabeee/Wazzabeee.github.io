## How to use
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Wazzabeee/plagiarism_checker

# Go into the repository
$ cd plagiarism_checker

# Install requirements
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
$ python main.py C:/Users/Desktop/papers -s 2 -o C:/Users/Desktop/results
```

## First run
On the first run you might get :
- an ImportError from pdfminer library 
``` 
ImportError: cannot import name 'uint_value' from 'pdfminer.pdftypes' (C:/.../pdfminer/pdftypes.py)
```
To fix this, please uninstall pdfminer3k and pdfminer.six via 
``` pip uninstall pdfminer3k ```
``` pip uninstall pdfminer.six ```
Then install them again via 
``` pip install pdfminer3k ```
``` pip install pdfminer.six ```


- a TypeError from Slate3k library 
```
TypeError __init__() missing 1 required positional arg 'parser' in "C:/.../slate3k/classes.py
```
To fix this you'll need to modify `class PDF(list):` in `C:/.../slate3k/classes.py`. In `def __init__()` change both `if PYTHON 3:` to `if not PYTHON 3:` on lines 58 and 72.
