# Reading list 2023/24

For 2023 I challenged myself to read one book per week. In order to make this challenge more concrete, I decided to make it public so that I am somehow obliged to succeed in this challenge. It turned out that reading one book a week forced me to prioritize smaller books over the ones I really wanted to read... So I dropped that idea and now share here only a list of recently read books. I always share stories about these books on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/clement_dltl/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>. You can contact me there to discuss common readings.
