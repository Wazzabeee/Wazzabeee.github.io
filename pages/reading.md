# Reading list 2023

For 2023 I challenged myself to read one book per week. In order to make this challenge more concrete, I decided to make it public so that I am somehow obliged to succeed in this challenge.

* [x] Week of Jan 2 - *The Prince* by Machiavelli

* [ ] Week of Jan 16 - *The Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus
* [ ] Week of Jan 23 - *War* by Louis-Ferdinand Celine
